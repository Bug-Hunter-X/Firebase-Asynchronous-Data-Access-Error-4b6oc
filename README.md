# Firebase Asynchronous Data Access Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when working with asynchronous operations in Firebase Cloud Functions.  The problem arises when attempting to access data from a database before an asynchronous operation, such as a database read, has finished.

## Problem Description

The `bug.js` file contains a Firebase Cloud Function that attempts to access data from Firestore before the asynchronous database read is complete.  This leads to null or undefined values being used in subsequent operations, resulting in errors or unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the function.  It utilizes appropriate error handling and checks to ensure that data is available before attempting to access it.  This robust approach prevents errors caused by asynchronous data access.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the Firebase Admin SDK: `npm install firebase-admin`
3. Configure your Firebase project.
4. Deploy the `bug.js` function and observe the error.
5. Replace `bug.js` with `bugSolution.js` and deploy again to see the corrected behavior.
